## There are no stupid questions
.. but there are lazy ones, which is worse. At any moment, we've all not understood something, and then gradually worked and practiced with it to gain more understanding. If you don't really feel like writing a good description of your problem, why should others offer a good description of a solution? Learning doesn't stop at all, so it's best if you adopt a good learning mentality early on!

## What makes a good question?
Contrary to what many believe at first, a good question is characterized by effort and previous research into what's already available, and not necessarily the technical knowledge involved. People that help out, specially in a volunteer setting, are not really forced to help you over other people; it's in your best interest to make your question as appealing as possible so that many people look at it. More often than not, they are people that enjoy solving problems that others may have - take advantage of it!

With that in mind, how should you formulate a question? Here's a template that can serve as a guide for your questions, to ensure you've spent a good amount of effort yourself and can communicate your thoughts well. 

## Template

**Situation**: I'm trying to do X because of reason Y. I'm using tool T version V.

**Details**: I think I should approach X with approach A. A would/wouldn't work for X because of reason(s) R. There's also approach B, that may be better in this situation S. The tutorial for T seems outdated, or I couldn't find the answer of what I wanted.

**Attempts**: I tried to implement A like this:
```pawn
// ... code for A ...
```
It didn't work/it gave me error E/warning W. I tried to implement B like this:
```pawn
// ... code for B ...
```
It compiled fine, but it gave me error E under special condition C.

**Question(s)**:
1. Why did error E happen in B? I thought I had covered for it in code
2. Is there a better approach that isn't A or B?
3. Any improvements?

## Conclusion
As any guide, it shouldn't be followed blindly for any circumstance. However, it should help you start improving the quality of your effort, and therefore your questions! You're not expected to ask questions like that from one day to the next, just keep it in mind and see how much better people respond when you put more effort.
