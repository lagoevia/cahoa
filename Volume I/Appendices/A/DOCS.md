## What is documentation?
> Software documentation is written text or illustration that accompanies computer software or is embedded in the source code. The documentation either explains how the software operates or how to use it, and may mean different things to people in different roles. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_documentation))

Documentation is a resource that is available for many projects, and it's not one to take lightly! You should eventually get comfortable with reading the different types of documentation to find answers to your questions, and not only rely on people's answers to them. Sometimes, documentation will only be available within the source code itself; being comfortable with reading others' source code and thought process is another important skill to develop. Many times questions can be answered by searching through the docs.

## Why use documentation?
For example, here's a short example: [MySQL-Prepared-Statements](https://github.com/PatrickGTR/MySQL-Prepared-Statements). As you can see, it tells a reader:
- How to install the library
- How to use the library
- How to test the library
- More specific examples

If you wanted to use this library, you may have different questions: "How do I use X function?", "Why is Y variable there?", etc. It can seem easier and more productive to just ask what you want; however, it's not. Here's why:
- Documentation is made by a reputable source, either the creator or a maintainer, that is experienced with the topic at hand
- Documentation usually contains information that people would want to search for - it was made for a reason after all
- You will, more often than not, find more information at the project itself rather than from other people

With that in mind, documentation is not always up to date, if there at all. For more advanced/complex topics, you may have to dig into source code to find some of your answers. Even then, it may not be enough, or you may be genuinely stuck after spending considerable effort trying to understand something. That's when asking others comes into play, so it is vital to know how to properly ask questions.
