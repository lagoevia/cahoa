# CODE: A Hands-on Approach (cahoa)

For more information, see the [draft](https://gist.github.com/lagoevia/1d2daa353c2dac189273d80e3af2f333).

## Volume I
Volume I will focus on introductory topics. After completion, one should, amongst other things:
- Have experience with variables, arrays, and functions
- Understand how to separate code into modules
- Understand how to ask questions, use documentation, and debug code

Different projects will build up on concepts, and get students familiarized with them by applying them in game.

## Volume II
Volume II will expand on Volume I, and concentrate all of its chapters under one project: building a simple Team Deathmatch gamemode from scratch. Volume I is a prerequisite, as this volume assumes the student is familiar and has had experience with all concepts introduced in the previous volume.
